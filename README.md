## How?

Simply place the lantern on the side of a block, and as long as there is no block above, or below, the lantern will attach to the wall.

## Side Effects

In vanilla Minecraft, lanterns will break if their base block is destroyed, but in this mod, lanterns will float regardless. I plan to fix this in a later version, as soon as I figure out how.

## Compatibility

If you're using a resource pack that changes the lantern blockstate file, then you won't see the connection of the lanterns to the walls.
